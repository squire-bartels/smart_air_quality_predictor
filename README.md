# Smart City Air Quality Predictor

## Overview
The Smart City Air Quality Predictor is a web application that predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) using machine learning. This tool leverages pollutant data such as PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO2, O3, and SO2 to provide accurate AQI predictions. Built with Python and Streamlit, the app is designed to help urban planners, researchers, and individuals monitor air quality effectively.


## Features
• **Predict AQI**: Input pollutant levels and receive an accurate AQI prediction in real time.
• **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and interactive interface powered by Streamlit.
• **Deployed Online**: Accessible via Streamlit Cloud for ease of use.
• **Machine Learning Model**: Linear Regression trained on environmental and pollutant data.


## Data Source
The data is collected from the [World Air Quality Index (WAQI) API](https://aqicn.org/api/), which provides real-time air quality and weather data. The dataset includes pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, as well as weather parameters.
