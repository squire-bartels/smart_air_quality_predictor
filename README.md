## **Introduction**
The Smart Air Quality Predictor is an advanced Python-based system designed to monitor, analyze, and predict air quality levels. It integrates real-time data from the World Air Quality Index (WAQI) API with historical datasets to deliver actionable insights into global air quality. It also leverages statistical tools and visualization techniques to enhance the understanding of air quality trends and patterns.

## **System Requirements**
To use this system, you need:
- Python 3.8 or higher.
- Internet access to fetch real-time data and API dependencies.
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `requests`, `scikit-learn`, and `time`.

## **Features**
- **Real-Time Data Fetching**: Pulls air quality data (e.g., AQI, PM2.5, CO) from WAQI API for specific cities or regions.
- **Categorization of AQI**: Assigns AQI readings to qualitative categories such as *Good*, *Moderate*, *Unhealthy*, etc.
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Integrates with historical datasets (like Kaggle datasets) for trend analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Generates interactive visualizations to compare pollutants and analyze trends.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Provides future AQI predictions using machine learning models.
- **Export Capabilities**: Exports analyzed data to CSV for external use.
